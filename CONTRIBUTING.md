# Contributing

This project follows a **verification-first** workflow.

## Principles
- Prefer deterministic experiments (explicit seeds).
- Every numerical result should be traceable and replayable.
- Add tests for invariants and regression fixes.
- Keep commits small and reviewable.

## Pull Requests
- Include a short summary and motivation.
- Add or update tests under `tests/`.
- If adding a new experiment, add a minimal doc note under `docs/`.
