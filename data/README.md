# Data

Small committed examples:
- `toy_delta_lambda.png` — example plot from the toy Δ(λ) model
- `sample_lattice_trace.npz` — tiny placeholder trace

Heavy runs should go to `data/runs/` (ignored) or GitHub releases.

## OpenTimestamps
If you timestamp releases, keep hash pointers in `hash.txt` or release notes.
