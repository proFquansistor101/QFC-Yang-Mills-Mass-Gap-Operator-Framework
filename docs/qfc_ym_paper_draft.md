# QFC-YM Operator Framework (Draft Paper)

## Abstract
We present a reproducible, verification-first scaffold for operator-inspired toy models
and lattice-style experiments. The framework emphasizes deterministic replay, trace
serialization, and invariant-based gates suitable for CI and later governed execution.
