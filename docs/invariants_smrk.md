# SMRK Validity Constraints (Draft)

Placeholder invariants/constraints used as "verification-first gates".

## Minimal suite
- Spectrum summary: mean/std/min/max
- Gap indicator: Δ0 = λ2 - λ1
- Replay stability: identical outputs under same trace

These are not final mathematical claims; they are pragmatic engineering gates.
