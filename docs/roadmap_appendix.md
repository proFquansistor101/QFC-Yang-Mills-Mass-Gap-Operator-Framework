# 4-Year Roadmap (Appendix)

Staged build-up from toy operators to governed, replayable experiments.

## Year 1 — Tier 1: Toy operators (PoC)
- Δ(λ) toy operator + trace serialization
- Prime/shift-inspired operator family
- Verification gates: boundedness + self-adjoint checks (numerical)

## Year 2 — Tier 2: Lattice scaffolding
- Wilson-lattice placeholder upgraded towards SU(2)/SU(3) integration
- Multi-resolution SMRK confinement penalties
- Standardized trace format for lattice runs

## Year 3 — Replay + governance hardening
- Deterministic replay on CI
- Parameter sweep harness
- Evidence packaging: hashes + OpenTimestamps pointers

## Year 4 — Networked probes
- Probes as distributed compute nodes
- Periodic commitments (hash anchors)
- Aggregation + audit dashboard
